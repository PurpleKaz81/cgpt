# Documentation Index

This file is the canonical index for scoped markdown documentation under `docs/`.

Rule:
- Every markdown file under `docs/specs/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/runbooks/`, and `docs/roadmap/` must be linked in this file.

Core canonical docs remain:
- `README.md` (beginner-first usage)
- `TECHNICAL.md` (canonical command/reference behavior)
- `SECURITY.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `RELEASING.md`

## Specs

## New Doc Checklist

1. Place the new markdown file in one of:
   - `docs/specs/`
   - `docs/adr/`
   - `docs/runbooks/`
   - `docs/roadmap/`
2. Add a link to the file in the appropriate section of `docs/INDEX.md`.
3. If behavior/reference implications exist, also cross-link relevant sections in `TECHNICAL.md`.
